Download the tests from:
https://github.com/iamandrewli/lumiradx_tech_test/tree/master/automated_integration_tests

* Use the same venv that you created for the lumiradx tech test found here:
https://github.com/iamandrewli/lumiradx_tech_test/tree/master/automated_integration_tests

From the same venv
* pip install requests
* pip install pytest
* run tests by using the command 'pytest TESTNAME' e.g. pytest put_test.py 


Manual test set up
-----
Manual test were created and executed with the use of Postman.
